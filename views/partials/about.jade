      h2.about About Me
      p.about I'm a designer looking to solve real world problems through design.
      p.about I'm currently a product designer at Motif Investing and am also a graduate of General Assembly's 10 week User Experience Design Immersive Program. Before pursuing a career in design, I worked as an AngularJS developer, founded my own startup, worked in the finance industry, and was a Paratrooper in the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division. I wholeheartedly believe it's possible to have a positive impact on the world through empathic design.
