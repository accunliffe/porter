          h4.TSicons To parents of children that wear school uniforms the lack of planning outfits is a huge plus, and they want that same simplicity when buying the uniforms.

          h4.TSicons Currently, most online school retailers rely on a "school code" and traditional ecommerce navigation. Digging through emails to find the code was a major pain-point for parents who had to buy clothes in the middle of a semester.

          h4.TSicons Another pain-point with current online school uniform retailers was the amount of items displayed. Parents wanted items filtered out to the least amount of choices possible.

        h2.content Time Is Valuable
        h4.content The parents involved in testing listed time as their most valuable commodity, and greatest concern. More time not having to toil through ordering their childrens' uniforms meant more time with their children, less distraction from work, and more time for themselves. Four user flows were designed to facilitate the most common testing scenarios, which pleased users, and addressed all stakeholder needs.
